# Serverless Chatbot
This is the full stack project of the chatbot. 

## Front End:
The static front-end has been designed using vue. To run the application do:

```bash
cd front_end
npm run serve
```

The front end has been deployed in AWS S3

## Back End:
The backend has been designed using python. To run the project locally do:

```bash
cd back_end
python3 server.py
```

The back end is however deployed in a AWS lambda function. Check lamda_handler.py
